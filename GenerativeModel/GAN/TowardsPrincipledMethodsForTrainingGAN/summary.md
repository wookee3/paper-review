# Towards Principled Methods for Training Generative Adversarial Networks
---

* overview
  * This paper aims to make theoretical steps towards fully understanding the training dynamics of generative adversarial Networks

* Theoretical background
  * KL divergence is not symmetric

  \[
    KL(P_r||P_g) = 
  \]
